# algorithms_and_data_structures_practice 

A collection of typical, algorithm focused interview questions. 

I'm taking questions from Cracking the Coding interview, HackerRank.com, ProjectEuler.net, and other misc. sites/challenges. 

Most of the solutions are in java, with some in php and python.
